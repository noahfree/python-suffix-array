# suffix-array
This program creates a suffix array on the U.S. Constitution and uses it to tell the user how many times a given word appears in the document.

A faster suffix array search function was created but it currently contains bugs and hence does not work at the moment, so on large documents like the Constitution, the search takes longer to run than optimal.
